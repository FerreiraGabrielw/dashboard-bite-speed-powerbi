## About the Project

This dashboard, developed for the company BiteSpeed, offers a consolidated and actionable view of **sales operations and customer service performance**. It allows monitoring key sales and production metrics and, crucially, the average service time across different channels and regions, aiming to optimize processes and improve the customer experience.

## Technologies and Process

*   **Tools**: Power BI Desktop, Figma (prototyping and design), Microsoft Excel / CSV (data sources).
*   **ETL**: Data extracted from `.xls` and `.csv` files, transformed in Power Query (M) and modeled for consolidated analysis.
*   **Key Insights**: Financial and operational performance, regional performance, service time by channel/gender/employee, sales by product and category, and customer demographic insights.

## Repository Content

*   `data/`: Used database files (XLS/CSV).
*   `powerbi/`: Power BI dashboard `.pbix` file.
*   `quarto/`: `.qmd` file and its rendered HTML version.
*   `figma/`: Files related to the prototype and design in Figma.
